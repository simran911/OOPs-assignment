    "Abstraction is one of the four fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a process of simplifying complex real-world entities into their essential characteristics, focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction allows you to create a model of an object that hides the implementation details and exposes only the relevant features or behaviors."
